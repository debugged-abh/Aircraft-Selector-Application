# Aircraft-Selector-Application
The objective of this project was to select the most suitable aircraft model based on distance and air fuel consumption, with the goal of conserving fossil fuel and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Several skills were utilized to accomplish this objective. The project was developed using the Python programming language, with the Tkinter library used to create a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allowed users to input the origin, destination, and cruising speed of the aircraft. 
In the backend, Data filtering techniques were applied using the Pandas library to remove any noisy values and extract relevant information on aircraft models, fuel consumption (gallons/hr), and coverage (nautical miles). Data manipulation was performed to convert the filtered data into dictionaries based on coverage and gallons per hour, facilitating calculations and comparisons. Geolocation techniques were employed to determine the true distance between the origin and destination, which was used to calculate the flight duration in hours. Created a Machine Learning algorithm to calculate the flight time duration based on the obtained true distance through geo localizers. Decision-making processes involved calculating the fuel consumption by multiplying the flight duration by the gallons per hour, allowing for the identification of the aircraft model with the least fuel consumption and the highest coverage.
